## Getting Started

1. Place raw data in the `data/raw/` directory
2. Place your data preprocessing scripts in the `preprocessing/` directory
3. Use notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploration and analysis
4. Implement model training scripts in `training/`
5. Save trained models in `models/`
6. Store utility functions in `utils/`
7. Generated files and results will be saved in `outputs/`

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks well-documented with markdown cells
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document data preprocessing steps
- Track model versions and parameters
- Maintain requirements.txt or environment.yml
- Use clear naming patterns for output files with timestamps
- Never modify raw data files, always create new versions
- Include data documentation (data dictionaries, schemas)
