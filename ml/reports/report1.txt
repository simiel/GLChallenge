Based on the cluster analysis, I can identify the potential churn patterns. Let me break down each cluster and identify which ones represent likely churners:
Cluster 1 (29.0% of customers) - HIGH CHURN RISK üö®
Negative indicators:
Lowest transaction count (-0.28 std)
Lowest total transaction amount (-0.34 std)
Low transaction frequency (-0.21 std)
Highest days since last transaction (+0.15 std)
This cluster shows classic churn behavior with declining engagement
Cluster 0 (32.3% of customers) - STABLE ‚úÖ
Positive indicators:
Average transaction frequency (+0.05 std)
Good account balance (+0.06 std)
Regular transaction patterns
Low days since last transaction (-0.07 std)
Cluster 3 (32.9% of customers) - STABLE ‚úÖ
Positive indicators:
Good transaction frequency (+0.10 std)
Regular transaction patterns
Consistent engagement
Average age and balanced metrics
Cluster 2 (5.4% of customers) - HIGH VALUE, LOW RISK üíé
Very positive indicators:
Highest transaction amounts (+2.26 std)
High transaction count (+0.29 std)
Low days since last transaction (-0.22 std)
High total transaction amount (+2.34 std)
Cluster 4 (0.4% of customers) - OUTLIERS ‚ö†Ô∏è
Mixed indicators:
Extremely high transaction amounts (+8.20 std)
Low transaction frequency (-0.17 std)
Low minimum transactions (-0.29 std)
Very high variability in transactions
Recommendation for Churn Classification:
Churn Class (1): Assign customers from Cluster 1 (29.0% of customers)
Shows clear signs of disengagement
Declining transaction patterns
Increased recency (days since last transaction)
Non-Churn Class (0): Assign customers from Clusters 0, 2, 3, and 4 (71.0% of customers)
Show healthy engagement patterns
Regular transaction behavior
Good or improving metrics
This gives us a reasonable binary classification with:
Churn rate: 29.0%
Non-churn rate: 71.0%
